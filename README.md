Virtual Concierge for Boutique Café - Docker Blueprint
This project provides a modular, Docker-deployable blueprint for a Virtual Concierge web application for a boutique café. It features a simple frontend for customers to make reservations and a Python FastAPI backend that handles the reservation logic and persists data in Google Cloud Firestore.

Features
Café Description: A static section describing the café.

Table Reservation: Customers can submit reservation details (name, email, date, time, guests, preferred location, dietary preferences).

Firestore Integration: Reservation data is securely stored and retrieved from Google Cloud Firestore.

Modular Architecture: Separates frontend and backend into distinct services.

Dockerized: Easily deployable locally using Docker Compose.

Real-time Updates: Reservations list updates automatically upon creation or deletion (frontend polls the API).

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Docker Desktop: Includes Docker Engine and Docker Compose.

Download Docker Desktop

A Google Cloud Project with Firebase:

You need an active Google Cloud project.

Firebase initialized in your project.

Firestore Database set up (in Native mode).

Firebase Setup (Crucial Configuration)
This application uses Google Cloud Firestore for data persistence. The backend API needs credentials to connect to your Firestore database.

Create a Firebase Project:

Go to the Firebase Console.

Click "Add project" and follow the steps to create a new Firebase project.

Enable Firestore Database in your project (choose "Start in production mode" for better security, then set up rules).

Generate a Service Account Key:

In your Firebase project, navigate to Project settings (the gear icon next to "Project overview").

Go to the Service accounts tab.

Click "Generate new private key" and then "Generate key".

A JSON file will be downloaded to your computer. This file contains the credentials for your backend to authenticate with Firebase.

Rename this downloaded JSON file to firebase-service-account.json.

Place the Service Account Key:

Move the firebase-service-account.json file into the root of this virtual-concierge-app/ directory.

Example: virtual-concierge-app/firebase-service-account.json

Configure docker-compose.yml:

Open docker-compose.yml.

Locate the reservation-api service.

Replace your-firebase-project-id in the APP_ID environment variable with your actual Firebase Project ID (you can find this in your Firebase Console under Project settings > General > Project ID).

Ensure the volumes section correctly points to your firebase-service-account.json file. By default, it's set to ./firebase-service-account.json, assuming you placed it in the root directory.

Configure Firestore Security Rules:

In the Firebase Console, go to Firestore Database -> Rules.

IMPORTANT: For this blueprint, all reservations are stored under a fixed DEMO_USER_ID ("demo_cafe_user") for simplicity. In a real production app, you would implement proper user authentication (e.g., Firebase Authentication) and store data under request.auth.uid.

For this demo, use the following rules to allow read/write access to the DEMO_USER_ID's reservations. Replace your-firebase-project-id with your actual Firebase Project ID.

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read/write to reservations collection for the specific demo user
    // Replace 'your-firebase-project-id' with your actual Firebase Project ID
    match /artifacts/your-firebase-project-id/users/demo_cafe_user/reservations/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true; // WARNING: This is permissive for demo.
                                 // For production, use 'if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == DEMO_USER_ID;'
                                 // and implement proper authentication.
    }

    // Deny all other access by default
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}

Publish these rules.

Local Deployment
Once you have completed the Firebase setup:

Navigate to the project root:
Open your terminal or command prompt and go into the virtual-concierge-app directory.

cd virtual-concierge-app

Build and run the Docker containers:

docker-compose up --build

--build ensures that Docker images are built from their respective Dockerfiles.

This command will download base images, install dependencies, build your frontend and backend services, and start them.

Access the Application:

Open your web browser and go to: http://localhost

You should see the Virtual Concierge web application.

The backend API will be running on http://localhost:8000.

Usage
Fill out the reservation form and click "Confirm Reservation".

You will see a confirmation message, and your reservation will appear in the "Your Upcoming Reservations" list below the form.

You can delete existing reservations using the "Delete" button.

Check your Firebase Console to see the data being stored in Firestore under artifacts/your-firebase-project-id/users/demo_cafe_user/reservations.

Extending the Blueprint
This blueprint provides a strong foundation. Here are ideas for extending it:

Authentication: Implement proper user authentication (e.g., Firebase Authentication) for individual users, replacing the DEMO_USER_ID.

Admin Dashboard: Create a separate admin-dashboard-app service for café staff to manage reservations.

Notification Service: Add a dedicated notification-service (e.g., using Python/Node.js with SendGrid/Twilio) to send email or SMS confirmations to customers.

Real-time Admin Updates: Implement real-time updates for the admin dashboard using Firestore listeners.

Advanced Business Logic: Add more complex features like table availability checks, payment integration, or loyalty programs within the reservation-api-service.

CI/CD Pipeline: Set up GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool to automate building, testing, and deploying your Docker images to a container registry and then to a cloud environment (e.g., Kubernetes, Google Cloud Run).

Kubernetes Deployment: Create Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, Ingress, Secrets) to deploy your services to a Kubernetes cluster for production-grade scalability and reliability.

Monitoring & Logging: Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and centralized logging solutions.
